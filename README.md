# WinterBot

This is a Discord bot built with Node.js and the Discord.js library. The bot is designed to track the order of user registrations for scheduled events on a Discord server. It fetches scheduled events from the server, posts an event message for each event, and then keeps each message up to date with newly registered and unregistered users.
