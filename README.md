# WinterBot

This is a Discord bot built with Node.js and the Discord.js library. The bot is designed to track the order of user registrations for scheduled events on a Discord server. It fetches scheduled events from the server, posts an event message for each event, and then keeps each message up to date with newly registered and unregistered users.

## Features

- Posts scheduled event information to specified channel
- Keeps track of registered users in order of registration
- Lists previously registed users
- Logs errors to a specified log channel
- Saves and loads event data to/from .json file
- Posts weekly error reports to a specified channel (v1.0c+)

## Preview
